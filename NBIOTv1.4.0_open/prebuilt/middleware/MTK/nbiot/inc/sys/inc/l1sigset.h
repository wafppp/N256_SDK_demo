/*
** This file deliberately does not have multiple inclusion protection
** as it can be legitimately included twice in the same file.
**
** The KI_BASE_DEF() macro adds _SIGNAL_BASE to the end of the parameter
** given as the base name. This is done to enforce the GKI naming convention.
**
** This must never be included directly by any file outside of the kernel.
**
** WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING
**
** THE BASES WITHIN A SIGNAL SET SHOULD NOT BE CONDITIONALLY COMPILED
** IF POSSIBLE AS THIS CAN CAUSE SIGNAL ID'S TO MOVE AROUND. NEW BASES MUST
** BE ADDED TO THE END OF THE SET (OR USE A REDUNDANT ENTRY) TO MAINTAIN
** THE BASE NUMBERING FOR THE EXISTING BASES. IF A BASE IS CONDITIONALLY
** COMPILED THE ELSE CONDITION MUST HAVE RESERVED BASES SO THAT THE
** NUMBERING IS CONSTANT WHETHER THE CONDITIONAL IS ON OR NOT.
**
** FILES SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED INTO THIS FILE AS ANY ADDITIONS TO THE BASES
** WITHIN THE INCLUDED FILE WILL AFFECT THE NUMBERING OF ALL BASES DEFINED
** AFTER THE INCLUSION IN THIS FILE.
